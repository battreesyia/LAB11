Question : 
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health on weight. it can be calculated by taking your weight in Kg
and dividig by the square of your height in meters. Write a program that lets a teacher to calculate the BMI of 20 students.
The program should use three one dimensional arrays named studWeight that holds the weight in kg, studHeight that holds the height in meters
and studBMI that holds the calculated BMI for each student. 

The program contains the following functions.
> readData 
/*This function receives the studWeight and studHeight arrays from the main functions. it read the weight and height for all of hte students and stored them in the studWeight and
studHeight arrays respectively.*/
> calBMI 
/*This function receives one element of the studWeight and studHeight arrays. it calculate the BMI of each student based on her/his weight and height and then store the BMI in the studBMI array.*/
> display 
//This function displays the BMI of the students.
